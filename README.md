# Flutter Platform Channels Example

This repository provides an example of integrating platform channels in Flutter to communicate between Flutter and native Android/iOS code.

## Overview

Platform channels allow communication between Flutter code and platform-specific code (Java/Kotlin for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS), enabling access to platform-specific features or native APIs that are not directly available in Flutter.

This example demonstrates:

- Sending method calls from Flutter to native platform code and receiving responses back in Flutter.
- Invoking Flutter methods from platform-specific code.
- Handling errors and exceptions during method calls.
- Performing asynchronous operations over platform channels.

## Project Structure

- `lib/`: Contains the Flutter code for the example Flutter app.
- `android/`: Contains the Android-specific code (Java/Kotlin).
- `ios/`: Contains the iOS-specific code (Swift/Objective-C).
